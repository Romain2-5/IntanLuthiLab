# IntanLuthiLab

Welcome to the IntanLuthiLab repository.

We share openly here the softwares developed in our lab for recording and scoring electrophysiology data with the Intan recording system. Our hardware setup contains the following parts from IntanTech (https://intantech.com/):

C3100 RHD USB interface board
C3211 RHD 1-ft (0.3 m) ultra thin SPI interface cable
C3314 RHD 32-channel headstage
C3334 RHD 16-channel headstage

The two softwares proposed here are:

_Symply2Read_

Used for recording up to 8 animals at a time for long periods.

_VeryScore2_

Used to open, visualize and score the data in three main vigilent state (NREMS, REMS, Wakefulness) obtained with Symply2Read.
